  o better redirections of messages/errors from LaTeX/dvips/hevea

  o big sections with (*S
  o nicer pretty-print of [< and >]

version 1.0, 15/06/2001 
=======================
  o option --hevea-option to pass an option to hevea
  o escaped dollar sign in comments / documentation

    (no more use of \codeline and \endcodeline)

version 0.9, 18/12/2000
=======================
  o support for lex and yacc files (-impl option deprecated on these files)
  o when not in WEB style, index is by pages by default
  o noweb style is used if no sectioning command (*s at all
    so that ocamlweb can be used naively as a pretty-printer
  o option -latex-sects renamed into -noweb
  o bytecode compilation if no ocamlopt available
  o adequacy to ocaml 3.00 parser; labels are now indexed
  o installation: $(BINDIR) and $(TEXDIR) created if they don't exist
  o a comment in the LaTeX file now indicates that it is a generated
    file and gives the command line

version 0.8, 02/06/2000
======================= 
  o configuration with autoconf (thanks to Luc MAZARDO)

    constructor, type, module, etc.)
  o nicer quotes in identifiers

  o option -s, --short (no titles for files)
  o pretty-printing for == and !=
  o pretty underscores in identifiers (by redefinition of \_) 

version 0.7, 31/01/2000

  o fixed bugs in identifiers pretty-printing (Christian Rinderknecht)
  o fixed bug of code indentation inside item-like environments
  o renaming of \comment (resp. \endcomment) in \ocwcomment
    (resp. \ocwendcomment) to avoid a clash with Hevea own macros

version 0.6, 21/10/99
=====================
  o backtrack on the way to pretty-print comments (comments inside
    code lines produced line breaks)
  o many spaces inside code are printed as a single one (so that you
    can justify in ASCII without an ugly result with LaTeX)
  o unterminated ocamlweb comments (*i ... *i) now generate an error
    message 

version 0.5, 29/9/99
====================
  o better result with hevea (a single line break between code lines, etc.)
  o escape sequences ([...]) are no more active inside mathematics ($...$)
  o bootstrap is now completed (make bootstrap)
  o interfaces are no more inserted automatically before implementations 
    (patch from François Pottier)

version 0.4, 25/06/99
=====================
  o better handling of spaces before sections (thanks to François Pottier)
  o right-justified comments with (*r ... *)
  o misinterpretation of -- in strings fixes
  o better adequacy to caml tokens (and better pretty-printing)
  o single letter identifiers are also printed using macros \ocwlowerid, etc.
  o line breaks in strings are now correctly handled
  o more single-letter type variables output as greek letters. other
    type variables output as \ocwtv{id} which is customizable. An
    additional option --no-greek to ocamlweb disables to use of greek
    letters.  
  o option -q, --quiet

version 0.3, 17/06/99 (first official release)
=====================
  o \ocwnl has been splitted into \ocweol and \ocwindent for better
    code printing. a new corresponding function end_line has been
    added into output.ml.
  o \verb and \begin{verbatim} correctly handled during pretty-printing
  o option --no-web becomes --latex-sects
  o option --no-doc becomes --no-preamble
  o better sorting and pretty-printing of index entries
  o fixed bug in global index (interfaces were scanned after implementations
    when registering locations)
  o two different macros, \ocwlowerid and \ocwupperid, for capitalized and
    uncapitalized identifiers
  o the index now uses LaTeX labels and refs, where all the labels are of the
    kind \label{filename:location}

version 0.26, 02/06/99
======================
  o ocamlweb.sty: greatly improved by Claude Marché
  o various command line options: --no-index, --no-web, --latex-option, 
    --impl, --intf, --tex
  o two styles: WEB and LaTeX
  o ocamlweb now uses the ocaml parser to extract definitions and uses
    (the modules and classes language is not yet processed)

version 0.15, 18/5/99
=====================
  o first release (only for a few number of users who asked for)
