COMPILATION / INSTALLATION (source distribution)
================================================

  You need Objective Caml (>= 2.01) to compile the sources.
 
  1. Use configure script by typing "./configure"

     Default target directories are
     
       BINDIR = /usr/local/bin
       TEXDIR = /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/misc

     You can change these values using the --prefix option of configure
     (see ./configure --help)

  2. Compile with "make". It creates a binary file "ocamlweb".

  3. Install with "make install"

     Note: For some TeX installations, it may be necessary to run the
     command "mktexlsr" by hand to make ocamlweb.sty accessible by LaTeX.
      
     Alternatively, you may copy the needed files by hand: copy the binary 
     file "ocamlweb" in some directory that exists in your PATH
     environment variable, and copy the file "ocamlweb.sty" somewhere
     in your LaTeX input path (one of the directories listed in
     $TEXINPUTS). This file is needed to compile the documents
     produced by ocamlweb with LaTeX.

  4. (Optional) 

     You can run "make check" to `bootstrap' ocamlweb i.e. to apply it to
     its own code. If everything works fine, it will create a DVI document
     test/ocamlweb.dvi.

  5. Clean the sources with "make clean"


INSTALLATION (binary distribution)
==================================

copy the binary file "ocamlweb" in some directory that exists in your
PATH environment variable, and copy the file "ocamlweb.sty" somewhere
in your LaTeX input path (one of the directories listed in
$TEXINPUTS). This file is needed to compile the documents produced by
ocamlweb with LaTeX.


NOTE TO THE TexLive USERS
=========================

The LaTeX document produced by ocamlweb uses the 'fullpage' package
(to get margins adapted to A4 paper). This package has been rewritten
in the TeXLive and may cause bad DVI or PostScript (superposed
texts). If so, please get the standard FULLPAGE.STY by H.Partl from
http://www.ctan.org/.
